Hi, this is my first post here. I'm a software developer working as an employee. I have never started anything on my own, but I follow this community because it's super interesting. When it comes to finding an idea for a startup, one recurring tip is to find something that's a problem for you or that annoys you. In my case, I don't date much, so I use dating apps like Tinder and Bumble. However, after using these apps for years, I'm kind of frustrated because I don't have many dates. While this may be due to my profile not being attractive enough or me not being interesting enough, the main issue with these apps is the time they consume. They present potential matches one by one, making it a time-consuming process to find someone. Additionally, the blurry images and GPS requirements are frustrating.

## IMPROVEMENTS
To build a better dating app, here are ten things that could be done:

1. No blurry images. All profiles are visible to everyone even in free mode.
2. No swiping profiles one by one. Scroll down and swipe only when you want.
3. No watching the same faces over and over again.
4. Unlimited rewinds. If you accidentally discard someone, you can go back and give them a like for free (Of course!)
5. No GPS requirement.
6. Unlimited likes.
7. No chat feature.
8. Ask important questions.
9. Date calendar.
10. Affordable pricing (e.g., three coffees per month).

I'll expand my reasoning in 5 of these points:

## PRICING
Regarding pricing, it's currently too high in dating apps like Tinder. Everyone should be able to afford it. Even to have the ability to give likes or see who liked you, you have to pay a minimum of $4.99 per month (if you pay for a year). If you want to pay monthly, it's $14.99 per month. That's a lot of money for some people. Without paying, the experience is frustrating in terms of time and lack of features.

## NO CHAT FEATURE
The central idea of my post is that wasting time on dating apps is worse than not having a date at all. After all, the purpose of these apps is to connect with people in real life, not to spend endless hours chatting on a screen. So, my advice is to stop wasting time and instead, take action by meeting someone in person over a cup of coffee.

## NOT REPEATING FACES
It's frustrating to see the same profiles repeatedly even after swiping left. This is not only unhelpful for me, but also for the other person. The only reason dating apps do this is to make it seem like there are more people available than there actually are. Instead, a better approach would be to have an "Inbox 0" system like email clients where the screen remains empty until new profiles are available. This would provide a sense of completion and control over what you see. Revisiting discarded profiles should still be an option, and implementing this feature would also simplify the app's code.

## ASK QUESTIONS
Each person has their own set of preferences when it comes to choosing a partner. It's a natural way to filter and select the person that we think is the best fit for us. Rather than endless chatting, it could be as simple as letting other people know what really matters to you and allowing them to respond to those questions. This would only happen if there is mutual interest (a match!).

## DATE CALENDAR
After finding a potential match, the focus should shift to planning a real-life date rather than endless online communication. This could be facilitated through a user-friendly interface that allows users to suggest a time and place for the date. Once the plans are made, the dating app's involvement should end, and the users can begin building a real relationship in person.

That's it. With these idea I think a dating app could be better for everyone.

### DO I THINK THIS IS VIABLE INDIE HACKER IDEA?
In my opinion, this idea may not be viable as an indie hacker idea as it follows a BTC (Business-To-Consumer) model, and developing consumer apps can be quite capital intensive. Lot of money necessary to promote the app via marketing, lot of machine power to manage thousands of profiles and a lot of requests to the servers

My second point is that creating the envisioned app would only be the initial phase. To make it financially sustainable through a low monthly charge, you would require a substantial user base. Although, as an indie hacker, you would only need to cover server costs and your own income, not millions of dollars. Nonetheless, I believe the app would need to achieve critical mass, which may require at least 60,000 users who adore the app and a minimum of 5% of them ready to pay you $3.99 per month, much less than the cheapest Tinder subscription.

## WHAT DO YOU THINK?
As previously stated, having an idea is the first step towards building a startup. While I do not have a feasible idea at the moment, I do have an idea that could potentially enhance the dating experience by saving time and money.

What are your insights? Are there any existing apps that are similar to this idea? Do you believe it is a foolish concept? Please share your opinion. Thank you!
